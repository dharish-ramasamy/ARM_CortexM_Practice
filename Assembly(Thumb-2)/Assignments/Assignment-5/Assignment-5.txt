1. Write to interface Potentiometer using ADC and print the raw values onto the console. Also implement the following:

ADC raw value < 1000 then both LEDs are OFF

1000 < ADC raw value < 2000 then only Yellow LED is ON

2000 < ADC raw value < 3000 then only Red LED is ON

ADC raw value > 3000 then both LEDs are ON
